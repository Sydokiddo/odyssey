## **About Odyssey**

Odyssey is a Minecraft mod for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) 1.20.1 that features a wide variety of non-specific features and quality of life changes that expand upon and enhance the base game and its content! Most features are entirely configurable through the use of Mod Menu and fit nicely with other mods or just base Minecraft on its own.
